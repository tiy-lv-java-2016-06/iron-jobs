## Description
This is your first time working in a group officially.  You will be working with 1 or 2 other people on a job board.  As the backend group you are responsible for making the REST api required to power this site.  The front end will make the site run.

## Details
This is a very basic job board site.  A user will be able to login/register.  They can then look for jobs or post a job of their own.  If they apply the user will be linked to the posting.

## Requirements
* Create a `User` class that has/can do the following:
	* Username
	* Password
	* email address
	* Token for API
	* location: City/State
* Create a `Posting` class that has the following:
	* Owner (relationship to the `User`)
	* Title
	* Description
	* Salary Range Start
	* Salary Range End
	* Date created
	* Location
	* Applicants (ManyToMany relationship to `User`)
* End Points (minimum but not all inclusive)
	* login and return a token or register a new user and return a token
	* Retrieve the current user for the token provided

		* Reverse choronological order
		* Option to filter by salary and location
